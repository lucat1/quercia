# The `go` library

::: warning

This library requires `go >= 1.13` in order to be installed. It is shipped with
the native `go modules` feature, and we offer no official support for other
package managers.

## Installation

To get this library run this command inside the root of your monolith
application(where your `go.mod` is located):

```sh
go get -u github.com/lucat1/quercia
```
